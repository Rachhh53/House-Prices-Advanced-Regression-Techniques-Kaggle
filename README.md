## MSDS 422 Module 1 Assignment 1: House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques EDA (Kaggle) 
### Management/Research Question:
**In layman’s terms, what is the management/research question of interest, and why would anyone care?**<br>
```diff
+ The research question of interest is: What features impact sales price? Someone might care about this
+ in order to set the price of a house on the market based on these features knowing that, for example, a fire
+ place making a house more valuable to buyers. Another reason someone might care is if a certain feature has a
+ negative correlation with house price - they might want to change or spin that feature for the sale.
```
### Requirements:
You are to conduct EDA on the dataset as follows. <br>
**1. Provide appropriate descriptive statistics and visualizations to help understand the marginal distribution of the dependent variable.**<br>
**2. Investigate missing data and outliers.**<br>
**3. Investigate at least three potential predictors of the dependent variable and provide appropriate graphs / statistics to demonstrate the relationships.**<br>
**4. Engage in feature creation by splitting, merging, or otherwise generating a new predictor.**<br>
**5. Using the dependent variable, perform both min-max and standard scaling in Python.**<br>

**1. Conduct your analysis using a cross-validation design.<br>
**2. Conduct EDA and provide appropriate visualizations in the process.<br>
**3. Build a minimum of two separate regression models using the training set.<br>
**4. Evaluate polynomial, indicator, dichotomous, & piecewise model components.<br>
**5. Create at least one feature from the data set.<br>
**6. Evaluate the models’ assumptions.<br>
**7. Evaluate goodness of fit metrics on the training and validation sets.<br>
**8. Submit predictions for the unseen test set available on Kaggle.com.<br>
**9. Provide your Kaggle user name and a screen snapshot of your Kaggle scores.<br>
**10. Discuss what your models tell you in layman’s terms<br>
