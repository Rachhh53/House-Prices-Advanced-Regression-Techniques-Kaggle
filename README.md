## MSDS 422 Module 1 Assignment 1: House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques EDA (Kaggle) 
### Management/Research Question:
**In laymanâ€™s terms, what is the management/research question of interest, and why would anyone care?**<br>
```diff
+ The research question of interest is: What features impact sales price? Someone might care about this<br>
in order to set the price of a house on the market based on these features knowing that, for example, a fire<br>
place making a house more valuable to buyers. Another reason someone might care is if a certain feature has a <br>
negative correlation with house price - they might want to change or spin that feature for the sale.
```
### Requirements:
You are to conduct EDA on the dataset as follows. <br>
**1. Provide appropriate descriptive statistics and visualizations to help understand the marginal distribution of the dependent variable.**<br>
**2. Investigate missing data and outliers.**<br>
**3. Investigate at least three potential predictors of the dependent variable and provide appropriate graphs / statistics to demonstrate the relationships.**<br>
**4. Engage in feature creation by splitting, merging, or otherwise generating a new predictor.**<br>
**5. Using the dependent variable, perform both min-max and standard scaling in Python.**<br>
